### Hi there 👋
⚾ I'm **Jaken**, a 26 y/o married man born & raised in the outskirts of Houston, Texas. I currently work for the Houston Astros as a front-end developer.

🖊️ I blog about baseball by the numbers, front-end development, and data science. Posts can be found on my website at https://www.jakenherman.com

🌱 I'm currently learning R for Data Science and Machine Learning via DataCamp and I'm hoping to begin a Master of Science in Data Science program in Spring 2021.

🔭 I’m currently working on building an iOS app called Quitic that is a simplistic sobriety tracking app with APNs enabled to encourage users to embrace sobriety, badges to cheer them on along the way, and social sharing capability so they can get encouragement from friends and family.
